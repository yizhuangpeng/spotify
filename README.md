# Spotify

## This is a project that you can explore Spotify data. 

We covered data visualization, text analysis, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree and shiny app in this project.

Our project aims to help Spotify to reduce their investment in royalties by identify what are the attributes that made a song popular, and the platform could make use of the web tool to invest on the songs that are more likely to be popular while decrease the investment in other songs in the future.

**_If you want to run Rmd and/or R file, please download all files as a zip and then run the file._**

If you are interested to see our models and visualiaztion part, you may choose Rmd or HTML file to have a look. 

If you want to know how the model is applied, run the "Shiny App.R" file to have a look. 

If you prefer a more throughful report, you can choose HTML or Powerpoint(.pptx) for better understanding.

_Note that HTML and Powerpoint(.pptx) are in 'doc' folder._
